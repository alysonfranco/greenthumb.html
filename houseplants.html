       <p>I have two house plants that I've managed to keep alive. The snake plant does a pretty good job at
            regulating the air quality in the kitchen. My backyard faces east and so does the kitchen, so it's
            a pretty ideal spot for my indoor and outdoor plants to get sunlight thorught the day.
