# My Green Thumb ðŸª´
**10/2022:**
This was the first project I worked on in my Internet Applications class, based on my favorite hobby. While the code and layout may be a bit disorganized, it was my first time trying front-end development. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish during the semester. I only hope to keep on improving from here.<br>

Working with HTML wasn't too difficult for me; however, the introduction of CSS and Flexbox was a steep learning curve. I am proud of what I accomplished during my first time working with CSS.<br>
